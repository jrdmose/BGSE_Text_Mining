# BGSE_Text_Mining
Text mining project for BGSE data science program

In this project we identify Russian election interference efforts based on a vast twitter data set of users affiliated to the Russian Internet Research Agencey. Using word embeddings obtained through Word2Vec, we cluster tweets and identify groups of tweets aimed at pushing the public opinion on divsive topics towards the extremes of the political spectrum.

#### Scripts

The notebooks found in the scripts directory are ordered as follows:

1. data_exploration: Inital exploration of the tweet and user data

2. users_in_depth: Analysis of user patterns and cleaning

3. tweets_in_depth: Cleaning of the tweet data and tokenization

4. embedd_words: Word2Vec embeddings for the words

5. embedd_tweets: Embedding of tweets using trained vectors and initial analysis

6. cluster_analysis: Clustering and analysis of the found clusters.

#### Utils

The utils folder mostly contains utility function for plotting and cleaning
