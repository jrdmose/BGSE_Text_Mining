abstract="Recently, increasing attention has been attracted to Social Networking Sentiment Analysis. Twitter as one of the most fashional social networking platforms has been researched as a hot topic in this domain. Normally, sentiment analysis is regarded as a classification problem. Training a classifier with tweets data, there is a large amount of noise due to tweets' shortness, marks, irregular words etc. In this work we explore the impact pre-processing methods make on twitter sentiment classification. We evaluate the effects of URLs, negation, repeated letters, stemming and lemmatization. Experimental results on the Stanford Twitter Sentiment Dataset show that sentiment classification accuracy rises when URLs features reservation, negation transformation and repeated letters normalization are employed while descends when stemming and lemmatization are applied. Moreover, we get a better result by augmenting the original feature space with bigram and emotions features. Comprehensive application of these measures makes us achieve classification accuracy of 85.5{\%}.",

abstract="Recent years have witnessed considerable advances in information retrieval for European languages other than English. We give an overview of commonly used techniques and we analyze them with respect to their impact on retrieval effectiveness. The techniques considered range from linguistically motivated techniques, such as morphological normalization and compound splitting, to knowledge-free approaches, such as n-gram indexing. Evaluations are carried out against data from the CLEF campaign, covering eight European languages. Our results show that for many of these languages a modicum of linguistic techniques may lead to improvements in retrieval effectiveness, as can the use of language independent techniques.",
