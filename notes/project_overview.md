### Text Mining Project

Tasks to do:

1. Review the literature on political influence efforts. Why are the various techniques used.
    - This part goes more into the filed of politics, geopolitics and social sciences.
    - Need to explain what are the benefits of such campaigns for actors like Russia or China, or the US. Why would a country use these technqiues
    - Try to find examples to illustrate.
    - Finding the reason why, can already help to shape the answer or at least asking the right questions in terms of HOW.

2. Explore the Twitter data.
    - Produce useful summary statistics, find patterns
    - This should also help us to define the right questions and strategies for the modeling part.

3. Develop measures for identifying all or some of the strategies used by trolls.
    - Here we should use the techniques described in the course
    - We can and should experiment with various approaches
    - Important question: What's the difference between a state actor and a regular online troll? Can we even make out differences?
    - What's the difference between tweets resulting from an already polarized political landscape (i.e. Fox News vs. CNN) and active tactics used by outside players. Is there even one? Or is internal polarization indistinguishable from external actors?
    - Can we spot differences between local and foreign actors (maybe semantically)?
    - We need to come up with a proper theory for this part.

4. Present results coming from the measures we developed.
    - Answer some follow up questions
    - Identify next steps

### Literature


Questions to answer:
- What drives political influence campaigns? Who does it and why?
- Which strategies are used for which goal?

Strategies defined by Martin & Shapiro:
- Defame
- Persuade
- Polarize
- Shift agenda
- Undermine institutions

Overreaching Topic:
- "Challenge truth and trust" which are seen as the cornerstones of western democracies
- Global struggle for power (?)

Idea I would like to focus on:
Struggle for power between US and Russia
What are the Russian rationals behind using such techniques?
How could the influence politics?
Is there overall strategy behind the use of all 5? -> Weaken US, allows Russia to shift policy efforts, see Middle East (Syria) and Ukraine. US mostly held up with domestic politics nowadays.
Clear challenge to Clinton.
Undermine the public discussion in general, hinder a constructive discussion

Way to go:
- Go through each of the 5 strategies, try to come up with a sensible theory why they could be used by Russia

### Short Summaries of Literature provided by Hannes / Nandan

#### Allcot and Gentzkow - Social Media and Fake News in 2016 Elections
- Try to offer theoretical and empirical background for fake news debate
- Discuss economics of fake news
- Provide economic model for fake news using consumer utility
- Present data on consumption of fake news
- Discuss importance of social media for fake news
- Try to find out who is more likely to follow fake news

#### Bradshaw and Howard - Challenging truth and trust: A global inventory of organized social media manipulation
(Very broad article and scope)
- Key Topic: Challenge or threat to democracies through social media manipulation
- Focus on social media platforms
- Report analyses trends of organized media manipulation, strategies, capacities and resources
- Key Findings:
    - Many countries engage in such tactics
    - Large share comes from countries where political parties spread disinformation
    - Most countries in global south, use of chat apps
    - Computational propaganda still involves social media, but makes more use of paid advertisements and SEO
    - Social media manipulation is a business

#### Duclos, Esteban & Ray - Polarization: Concepts, Measurement, Estimation
- Develop a measurement theory for polarization (whatever that means)
- How can we measure polarization?
- Idea: Identification-alienation framework.
- Polarization is related to alienation that individuals and groups feel from one another, but such a thing is fuelled by notions of within-group identity.
- Try to develop indicies of polarization for which individuals identify themselves only with those with similar income levels  

#### Gentkow and Shapiro - What drives Media Slant? Evidence from US Daily Newspapers
- Slant: Media alignment with certain ideas / bias
- Construct index of media slant that measures similarity of a new's outlets language to that of congressional Republicans or Democrats
- Estimate a model of newspaper demand that incorporates slant explicitly
- Readers have an economically significant interest for like minded news
- Firms respond to consumer preferences
- Identity of a newspaper's owner  explains far less the variation in slant

#### Hindman - Disinformation, Fake News and Influence Campaigns on Twitter
- Study large number of tweets which linked to fake and conspiracy news outlets
- Investigate fake and conspiracy news before and after 2016 elections
- Find that disinformation is a big problem, even after the elections
- Just a few fake and conspiracy outlets dominate during the election
- Most accounts seem to be bots or semi-automated accounts
- Accounts spreading fake news are extremly well connected
- Fake news during elections did not just adpot conservative or Republican leaning ideas, though it has become more Republican since


### How do Disinformation Campaigns Work, what are the goals?

#### Media Manipulation and Disinformation Online
Focus on internet subcultures
- Take advantage of media ecosystem to manipulate news, set agendas and propagate ideas
- Increase visibility of ideas
- Medias dependence on social media and metrics makes them vulnerable to manipulation
- Media manipulation may contribute to decreased trust of mainstream media, increased misinformation and further radicalization


### What Drives Russian Efforts in US Elections?

#### Office of the Director of National Intelligence - Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections
- Declassified version of assessment about Russian cyber activities done by US intelligence agencies
- Motivation and scope of Moscow's intentions regarding US elections
- Use of cyber tools and media campaigns to influence US public opinion
- Russian leadership invests significant resources to transmit what it views as consistent, self-reinforcing narratives regarding its desires and redlines

###### Key Findings
- Moscow has longstanding desire to undermine US-led liberal democratic order
- Russia's goals with respect to 2016 elections were to undermine public faith in US democratic process, denigrate Hillary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency
- Russian Government had clear preference for Trump
- Influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations, with efforts by Russian agencies, state media and paid social media users ("trolls")
- Kremlin sought to advance longstanding desire to undermine US-led liberal democratic order, which Putin and others view as threat to Russia and Putin's regime
- **Highlight that there were changes in strategy during the elections**
    - When Clinton was leading over Trump, Russia focused efforts on discrediting here
    - Before elections, Russia argued that these are rigged, but immediately stopped once their favorite, Trump, was elected (#DemocracyRIP)
- Russia used trolls as well as RT to denigrate Clinton
- Promotion of radical discontent with current state of politics to polarize
- Reports on alleged US election fraud, "lack of democracy" in United States

-> So what's / was the goal of Russian activities?
- Undermine Clinton
- Undermine trust in US political institutions
- Push / favour Trump
- Undermine US political power
- Target and defame political actors on the left side of the political spectrum
- Undermine trust in Democratic party
- These strategies actually changed over the course of the elections, depending on the current status

#### Mueller Report (Focus on IRA and Russian Social Media Campaign) (Pages 14-)
- Internet Research Agency carried out social media campaigns to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the US
- The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the US political system
- Started to as a generalized program, targeted to sow discord in the US political system
- Evolved from that to a targeted operation, favoring Trump and disparaging Clinton
- Began operations in United States as early as 2014, using fictitious US personas, IRA employees operated social media accounts and group pages designed to attract US audiences
- Addressed divisive US political and social issues
- Posted derogatory information about a number of candidates
- By early to mid 2016, IRA started to support Trump campaign and defame Clinton
- Number of IRA employees served as Twitter specialists
- Two strategies: First, IRA specialists operated Twitter accounts to create US personas
- Second: Operated network of automated Twitter accounts that enabled IRA to amplify existing content on twitter
- The personal accounts were used to attempt to influence US audiences on the election
- @TEN_GOP, @jenn_abrams, @America_1st  and some others
- Large follower numbers for these accounts
- Used to provoke reactions from users and medias, some media outlets also quoted tweets from such accounts and attributed them to real persons

#### Internet Research Agency (IRA)
- Russian Company based in St. Petersburg, engaged in online influence operations on behalf of Russian business and political interests
- Also known as a "Troll Farm"
- Attempted to influence 2016 elections
- Has been indicted by US grand Jury

### How do certain strategies described in the document from Hannes and Nandan be related to these activities?

1. Polarization: A divided society turns against itself. A society that cannot come together to find a common ground is (a) unlikely to unite against outside aggressors, (b) easier to manipulate, (c) caught up with itself. (See in particular the activities of IRA regarding BlackLivesMatter, focused on spreading distrust, not pushing one view over another)

2. Defamation: Especially in the later stages of the 2016 elections, goal of IRA actors to denigrate Clinton and her campaign (See Mueller report). Clear goal of shaping political and public support towards Trump, as indicated by Intelligence Community

3. Persuasion: Opposite target of defamation. Persuade citizen into voting for Trump.

4. Shift Agenda: Unclear so far? Saw some mentions in Intelligence Report of IRA targeting fracking efforts in US in order to shift political agenda away from fracking. More nuanced, targeted efforts?

5. Undermine trust in institutions: Falls in a similar category like polarization. Leads to split in society. In countries with weak institutions, this can even lead (or support) full blown revolutions or insurgencies, see Donbas and Crimea.

Both defamation and persuasion are used in conjunction with polarization and undermining of institutions. Can be used together, e.g. BLM moved used to polarize, then push against Clinton using defamation and support Trump / others to increase split in society. I would argue that the common goal is to weaken the strategic position of the US through domestic politics.

- Dividing the country leads to focus on internal issues
- Support for Trump should put favorable (towards Putin / Russia) leadership into power
- Defamation of Democrats and Clinton clearly aligned with (perceived) antagonistic position of Clinton towards Putin's regime
- Shifting agenda: more research needed
- Undermining trust in institutions has similar effect like polarization, hinders political process

Clear Russian geopolitical strategy, Putin does not want Russia to be dependent on either US or Chinese interests, strengthen power in middle east, Europe and rest of the world. Historically, US has played role of "world police", Russia is challenging this notion. We can see similar efforts coming from China. Also, not unlike tactics used by other actors, including US, NATO countries.

Next Steps: Find support for these claims in
(a) Reports on geopolitics and Russian strategy.
(b) Find academic support for effects of polarization, distrust in institutions on political decision making, ability of countries to function.

### Literature on Polarization

What is polarization and how does it affect political decision making?

- Divergence of political attitudes to ideological extremes
- Especially important in two party system like the US, moderate opinions lose power and influence
- Implications are not entirely clear, but it alters political process and political composition of general public
- Most importantly in political decision making, causes increased gridlock and partisanship, at cost of quality and quantity of passed legislation
- Therefore, polarization hamper transparency, oversight and government's ability to handle long-term issues
- Political polarization can undercut agreement on foreign policy and harm the international standing
- Divisiveness on foreign affairs strengthens enemies, discourages allies and destabilizes a nations determination
- When US conducts relations abroad and appears divided, allies are less likely to trust promises, enemies are more likely to predict weaknesses and uncertainty as to the country's position in world affairs rises
- Second, elite opinion has a significant impact on the publics perception and understanding of foreign policy, a field where Americans have less prior knowledge to rely on

#### DiMaggio - Have American Social Attiudes become more polarized?

#### Fiorina, Morris P.; Abrams, Samuel J. (1 June 2008). "Political Polarization in the American Public"
- Polarization narrative prominent in 2000 and 2004 elections
- Notorious red blue map of the US is actually not that old! Started in 2000
- focus on polarization in the mass public
- In US politics, polarization if often described as bimodal distribution of political views, with two modes lying at the extremes
- Argue that it's not entirely clear how to measure polarization
- Sorting has occurred alongside party lines and religion

#### Jones - Party Polarization and Legislative Gridlock
- Finds that higher party polarization increases the likelihood of encountering gridlock on a given proposal
- Divided government itself does not cause gridlock
- However, higher party polarization increases gridlock
- Unified government is just as prone to gridlock as a divided government when parties are highly polarized and neither party has a large majority
- Divided government is just as productive as unified government when party polarization


#### Schultz - Perils of Polarization for US Foreign Policy
- threat for US standing in the world comes from within
- Issue of partisan polarization
- Polarization of ideological positions of political elites
- Mentions affective polarization and negative partisanship: Distrust and dislike from the other party, making agreement harder
- Discusses three challenges stemming from polarization to US public Policy
- More difficult to get bipartisan support for ambitious or risky undertaking, particularly the use of military force and the conclusion of treaties
- Hard to agree across parties on the lessons of foreign policy failure, complicating efforts to learn and adapt
- Risk of dramatic policy swings complicates ability to make long term commitments
- Overall vulnerability to foreign intervention in political system

#### McCormick and Wittkopf - Bipartisanship, Partisanship and Ideology in Congressional-Executive Foreign Policy Relations
- View of foreign policy after Vietnam war and as a product of partisan and ideological discord
- There used to a belief that "politics stops at the waters edge"
- Authors try to find out whether this is the case or not

#### Beinart, Peter (2008). "When Politics No Longer Stops at the Water's Edge: Partisan Polarization and Foreign Policy". In Pietro S. Nivola & David W. Brady (ed.). Red and blue nation? Volume Two: Consequences and Correction of America's Polarized Politics. Washington, DC: Brookings.
- chief problem with polarization is its effect on America's foreign and military Policy
- when US engages as an enemy or friend abrad, chances of success are heightend by coherent political support at home
- when nation appears divided, friends discount promises and enemies anticipate weaknesses
- this is what happend in Vietnam
- American people are heavily influenced by elite opinion on matters about which they are personally uninformed
- Elite views can be very influential when it comes to foreign and military policy

### Unifying literature and Russian Intelligence Efforts
- Social science literature supports the findings from US intelligence reports
- also argues that polarization can greatly harm political decision making and thus position of US as a global superpower, unable to continue to project force anywhere
- How can Russia try to polarize the US debate?
- Use the strategies discussed by Shapiro and Martin
- Push extreme views on both ends of the political spectrum
- Hoping for large coverage or impact
- Amplified by US media system
- Picking up divisive topics for maximization of viewer numbers

### Data
https://about.twitter.com/en_us/values/elections-integrity.html

- Include all public, nondeleted Tweets from accounts Twitter belives to be connected to state based information operations such as IRA

- Massive data set, many non-English tweets. Makes sense for us to focus on English tweets, since we can hardly interpret others.
